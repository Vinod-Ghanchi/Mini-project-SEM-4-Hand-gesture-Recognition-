# Mini-project-SEM-4-Hand-gesture-Recognition-
## Abstract
- We are performing a project that will recognize hand movements and perform features based on the movement made by the person. This project will be similar to face detection systems which are used for unlocking mobile phones
- We will be making a project that will recognize hand gestures and movements from the webcam in real time and perform functions based on the movement of the hand and the positioning of the fingers.
- We will be using Python language. The libraries of NumPy and TensorFlow from OpenCV will be used to execute this project.
- At the end of this project, we should be able to recognize hand and/or face features from the webcam in real time. Our accuracy of the project is ___%
- We can use this feature to recognize sign language based on its respective meaning in English.
We can also alter system features such as volume control and a virtual mouse and also virtual painter.
